- **Navigation Control**: Control the WebView's navigation, including back, forward, and reload actions.
- **Custom URL Loading**: Handle custom URLs and intercept navigation events.
- **WebView Settings**: Adjust WebView settings like zoom, scroll behavior, and display options.
- **Loading Indicators**: Show a loading spinner or progress bar while the page is loading.
- **Error Handling**: Display custom error messages for network issues or page load failures.

### How to Use:
